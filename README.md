task1: Implement Caesar Cipher- Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

task2: Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images

task3: Build a tool that assesses strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength

task4: Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers

task5: Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. Display relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. Ensure the ethical use of the tool for educational purposes.
